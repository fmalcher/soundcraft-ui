**Connection library for the Soundcraft Ui series mixers (Ui12, Ui16 and Ui24R), written in TypeScript/JavaScript**

This library provides a generic connection interface for Soundcraft Ui mixers.
It can be used in Node.js or in the browser to control most of the mixer's features without using the built-in web app.

## Installation

```sh
npm i soundcraft-ui-connection
```

## Names and trademark

This project is **not** associated with Soundcraft. It is an open-source community project with no connection to the companies that develop, produce, and sell the mixer.
All trademark and names are the property of their respective owners.

## Contributing

This library is open-source, and contributions are welcome! Although tested thoroughly, this software likely contains bugs and does not cover all aspects of the mixer yet. You can help by reporting bugs or requesting features through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fmalcher/soundcraft-ui/issues). Even better, create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/fmalcher/soundcraft-ui/pulls) with a bug fix or feature implementation. If you are unsure about how to proceed, let's talk!

I create this library in my free time and without any financial compensation other than sponsorship.
